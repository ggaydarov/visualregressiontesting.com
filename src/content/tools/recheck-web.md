Diffing all elements and CSS attributes of a rendered website. So instead of a pixel-diff, tells you "difference in font: times roman vs times new roman". Comes with filtering and ignoring capabilities (e.g. lets you filter/ignore font difference, but not text). Java-based, integrates with Selenium and JUnit. Comes with an open source CLI and a (paid) GUI for one-click maintenance (same change applied everywhere). Chrome extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recheck-web-demo/ifbcdobnjihilgldbjeomakdaejhplii) for easy trial available.
